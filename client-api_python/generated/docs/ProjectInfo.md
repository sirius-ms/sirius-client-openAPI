## Example

```python
from PySirius.models.project_info import ProjectInfo

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of ProjectInfo from a JSON string
project_info_instance = ProjectInfo.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(ProjectInfo.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
project_info_dict = project_info_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of ProjectInfo from a dict
project_info_from_dict = ProjectInfo.from_dict(project_info_dict)
