# Rsirius::Zodiac

User/developer friendly parameter subset for the ZODIAC tool (Network base molecular formula re-ranking).  Needs results from Formula/SIRIUS Tool

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**enabled** | **character** | tags whether the tool is enabled | [optional] 
**consideredCandidatesAt300Mz** | **integer** | Maximum number of candidate molecular formulas (fragmentation trees computed by SIRIUS) per compound which are considered by ZODIAC for compounds below 300 m/z. | [optional] 
**consideredCandidatesAt800Mz** | **integer** | Maximum number of candidate molecular formulas (fragmentation trees computed by SIRIUS) per compound which are considered by ZODIAC for compounds above 800 m/z. | [optional] 
**runInTwoSteps** | **character** | As default ZODIAC runs a 2-step approach. First running &#39;good quality compounds&#39; only, and afterwards including the remaining. | [optional]
