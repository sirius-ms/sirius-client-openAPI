All the returned traces are &#39;projected&#39;, which means they refer not to the original retention time axis,  but to a recalibrated axis. This means the data points in the trace are not exactly the same as in the raw data.  However, this also means that all traces can be directly compared against each other, as they all lie in the same  retention time axis.
