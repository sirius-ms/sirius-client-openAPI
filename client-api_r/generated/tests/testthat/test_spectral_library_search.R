GAUSSIAN: Treat peaks as (un-normalized) Gaussians and score overlapping areas of PDFs. Each peak might score against multiple peaks in the other spectrum.  MODIFIED_COSINE:  This algorithm requires that there is at most one pair of peaks (u,v) where the m/z of u and v are within the allowed mass tolerance. To be used for analog search with different precursor masses.
