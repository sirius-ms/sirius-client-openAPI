  abstract  = {Despite the over 100-y history of mass spectrometry, it remains challenging to link the large volume of known chemical structures to the data obtained with mass spectrometers. Presently, only 1.8\% of spectra in an untargeted metabolomics experiment can be annotated. This means that the vast majority of information collected by metabolomics is ``dark matter,'' chemical signatures that remain uncharacterized (Fig. 1). For a genomic comparison, 80\% of predicted genes in the Escherichia coli genome are known. In a bacteriophage metagenome, a well-known frontier of biological dark matter, the amount of known genes is 1--30\%, depending on the sample. Thus, one could argue that we know more about the genetics of uncultured phage than we do about the chemistry within our own bodies. Much of the chemical dark matter may include known structures, but they remain undiscovered because the reference spectra are not available in mass spectrometry databases.},

  abstract  = {Motivation: High-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) is among the most widely used technologies in metabolomics. Metabolites participate in almost all cellular processes, but most metabolites still remain uncharacterized. Determination of the sum formula is a crucial step in the identification of an unknown metabolite, as it reduces its possible structures to a hopefully manageable set. Results: We present a method for determining the sum formula of a metabolite solely from its mass and the natural distribution of its isotopes. Our input is a measured isotope pattern from a high resolution mass spectrometer, and we want to find those molecules that best match this pattern. Our method is computationally efficient, and results on experimental data are very promising: For orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we correctly identify sum formulas for more than 90\% of the molecules, ranging in mass up to 1000 Da.

  abstract  = {Untargeted metabolomics commonly uses liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to measure abundances of metabolites; subsequent tandem mass spectrometry is used to derive information about individual compounds. One of the bottlenecks in this experimental setup is the interpretation of fragmentation spectra to accurately and efficiently identify compounds. Fragmentation trees have become a powerful tool for the interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry data of small molecules. These trees are determined from the data using combinatorial optimization, and aim at explaining the experimental data via fragmentation cascades. Fragmentation tree computation does not require spectral or structural databases. To obtain biochemically meaningful trees, one needs an elaborate optimization function (scoring).
We present a new scoring for computing fragmentation trees, transforming the combinatorial optimization into a Maximum A Posteriori estimator. We demonstrate the superiority of the new scoring for two tasks: Both for the de novo identification of molecular formulas of unknown compounds, and for searching a database for structurally similar compounds, our method SIRIUS 3, performs significantly better than the previous version of our method, as well as other methods for this task.
SIRIUS 3 can be a part of an untargeted metabolomics workflow, allowing researchers to investigate unknowns using automated computational methods.},

In evaluation using reference data, CANOPUS reached very high prediction performance (average accuracy of 99.7\% in cross-validation) and outperformed four baseline methods. We demonstrate the broad utility of CANOPUS by investigating the effect of microbial colonization in the mouse digestive system, through analysis of the chemodiversity of different Euphorbia plants and regarding the discovery of a marine natural product, revealing biological insights at the compound class level.},

In evaluation, MSNovelist correctly reproduced 61\% of database annotations for a GNPS reference dataset. In a bryophyte MS2 dataset, our de novo structure prediction substantially outscored the best database candidate for seven features, and a potential novel natural product with a flavonoid core was identified. MSNovelist allows predicting structures solely from MS2 data, and is therefore ideally suited to complement library-based annotation in the case of poorly represented analyte classes and novel compounds.Competing Interest StatementSB and KD are cofounders of Bright Giant GmbH.},
